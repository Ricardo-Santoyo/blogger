    - Bruh Momentum
    - Now today we'll be learning about bruh momentum. Now to understand "bruh" momentum,
      we need to understand what a "bruh" moment is. A "bruh" moment is a moment eliciting
      such a strong emotional reaction from a person that they can only react with
      "bruh". Now how large or small that "bruh" is will determine its "bruh" mass.
      For example, Karen taking the kids will carry a much larger "bruh" mass than
      when your pizza rolls are not finished. Now how fast this situation hits you
      will determine its "bruh" velocity represented by "V" and do not forget that
      it is a vector quantity. Now combing your knowledge of these two things, you
      can find "bruh" momentum, also a vector quantity by the vector of its "bruh"
      mass and "bruh" velocity. Now, try it!

    - Using Quantum Mechanics to Prove that Traps aren't Gay
    - "Ladies and gentlemen, the answer to the question \"Are Traps Gay?\" has finally
      been solved and it involves quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nNow, in case you don't
      know what quantum mechanics are, \"quantum mechanics is the study of how subatomic
      particles interact with the world.\" Now, his entire study is based on the theory
      of \"Shrodinger's Cat.\" While most of you are probably familiar with it, I'll
      explain it anyway. Imagine it like this: you have a Neko inside of a box. Now,
      until you open the box, you can't know if this Neko is cute or not. Therefore,
      until this box is opened, the Neko is both Cute and Not Cute until you definitively
      observe whether she is cute or not.\r\n\r\nNow, this gets applied to the real
      world in the way that light works. The way that light works is that sometimes
      it acts as a wave but other times it acts as a particle. Which it acts as changes
      whether or not you observe it.\r\n\r\nNow, to bring this back to traps. I have
      this theory that I like to call \"Shrodinger's Shlong.\" Here's how it goes:
      You don't know if a trap has a dick or not until you observe it. Therefore,
      traps are both Gay and Not Gay until you observe the Penis. However, when you
      think about it, if you actually go out of your way to observe the penis and
      confirm it or not, that's kind of gay because when you're actively searching
      to observe it, there's a chance that you might observe the penis, and that seems
      proof enough.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the people that don't seek to confirm whether
      or not the trap is actually a man or not are the ones who aren't gay. So, the
      way that you see it here is that living in ignorance is the only way to avoid
      traps being gay. However, when you think about it, the traps only really become
      gay when we observe them. Therefore, we are the ones that make the traps gay,
      not the traps being gay themselves.\r\n\r\nSo, when you think about it: is it
      the traps that are really gay - or is it us?"

    - Hey, Vsauce. Michael here!
    - Where are your fingers? Seriously. It's a pretty easy question. You should be
      able to answer it. But how do you know? How does anyone know anything? You might
      say, well, I know where my fingers are. I'm looking right at them. Or, I can
      touch them, I can feel them, they're right here and that's good. Your senses
      are a great way to learn things. In fact, we have way more than the usual five
      senses we talk about. For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception.
      This is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. It allows you
      to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your body is all in
      relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. We have
      way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and then some. But
      they're not perfect. There are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature
      sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. Can you turn your tongue upside
      down? If so, perfect. Try this. Run your finger along the outer edge of the
      tip of your upside down tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger,
      but in the wrong place. Our brains never needed to develop an understanding
      of upside down tongue touch. So, when you touch the right side of your tongue
      when it's flipped over to your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite
      side, where your tongue usually is but isn't when it's upside down. It's pretty
      freaky and cool and a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy
      of our senses, the only tools we have to get what's out there in here. The philosophy
      of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. Plato famously said
      that the things we know are things that are true, that we believe and that we
      have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or
      they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but don't get too confident
      because proven is not a synonym for true. Luckily, there are things that we
      can know without needing proof, without needing to even leave the house, things
      that we can know as true by reason alone. These are things that we know a priori.
      An example would be the statement "all bachelors are unmarried." I don't have
      to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. All bachelors
      are unmarried because that's how we define the word bachelor. Of course, you
      have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place.
      Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That's great. But how do you know? This time I mean
      functionally, how do you know? Where is knowledge biologically in the brain?
      What are memories made out of? We are a long way from being able to answer that
      question completely but research has shown that memories don't exist in the
      brain in single locations. Instead, what we call a memory is likely made up
      of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain
      cells, neurons. A major cellular mechanism thought to underlie the formation
      of memories is long-term potentiation or LTP. When one neuron stimulates another
      neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime LTP, wiring them more
      strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime.
      A collection of different brain cells, neurons that fire together in a particular
      order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation,
      becoming more sensitive to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same
      way later on in the future. They're a physical thing in your brain, firing together
      more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing. You memorized. This
      branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. It could be
      the memory of your first kiss. A living souvenir of the event. If I were to
      go into your brain and cut out those cells, could I make you forget your first
      kiss or could I make you forget where your fingers are? Only if I cut out a
      lot of your brain. Because memories aren't just stored in one relationship,
      they're stored all over the brain. The events leading up to your first kiss
      are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different
      networks, all added up together making what you call the memory of your first
      kiss. How many memories can you fit inside your head? What is the storage capacity
      of the human brain? The best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number
      of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections
      a single neuron can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated that
      we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. That's
      the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for 300 years. That's
      a lot of information. That is a lot of information about skills you can do and
      facts and people you've met, things in the real world. The world is real, right?
      How do you know? It's a difficult question, but it's not rocket science. Instead,
      it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place.
      The theory that the Sun moved around the earth worked great. It predicted that
      the Sun would rise every morning and it did. It wasn't until later that we realized
      what we thought was true might not be. So, do we or will we ever know true reality
      or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true?
      Discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching
      true objective actual reality. Can science or reason ever prove convincingly
      that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond
      your mind? That you don't just live in the matrix? No. Your mind is all that
      you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators.
      The final stop for all of that information is ultimately you. You are alone
      in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything
      else exists. It's called the egocentric predicament. Everything you know about
      the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. This mattered
      so much to Charles Sanders Peirce that he drew a line between reality, the way
      the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered
      through our senses and bodies, the only information we can get. If you want
      to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience
      your phaneron, not reality. The belief that only you exist and everything else,
      food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism.
      There is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. And
      there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn't created
      just three seconds ago along with all of our memories. It's a frightening realization
      that we don't always know how to deal with. There's even The Matrix defense.
      In 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady. She argued that she
      believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren't real. By using the matrix
      defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite
      view is just way healthier and common. It's called realism. Realism is the belief
      that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. Rocks and
      stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you weren't around to
      experience them. But you cannot know realism is true. All you can do is believe.
      Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not
      a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works.
      As to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he
      wrote, "If you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies beyond
      the phaneron, my answer is how should I know? I'm not dismayed by ultimate mysteries,
      I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what
      is behind the clatter I make while I type this paragraph." Humble stuff. What
      strikes me is the cat. Cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards
      are a fun place to be. It's a great way to get the attention of a human, they're
      warm and exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to
      get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. We aren't that
      much different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe.
      We will never be able to understand all of them. We won't be able to ever answer
      every single question, but walking around in those questions, exploring them,
      is fun. It feels good. And as always, thanks for watching.
